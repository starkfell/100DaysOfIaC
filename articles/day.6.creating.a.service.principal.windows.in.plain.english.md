# Day 6 – Creating a Service Principal in plain English (Windows Edition)

When using Azure, there are several reasons why you may be required to create a Service Principal. Such as

* Kubernetes
* Ansible
* Custom Applications

While [Microsoft's Official Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal) tells you everything you need to know, we wanted to provide you with a quick and safe way to create a new Service Principal without using the Azure Portal and in a way that can be programmatically integrated into your existing IaC automation. Follow the directions below to create a Service Principal in Azure using the Azure CLI.

> Note: This article was tested on Windows 10.

## Create the Service Principal

Use the Azure CLI to create a new Service Principal in the target Azure Subscription.

```powershell
$Azure_SP = az ad sp create-for-rbac `
--role "contributor" `
--name "iac-sp" `
--years 3
```

*Note: 
1. When you don't supply a value for **--role**, then the Service Principal will be granted **contributor** rights across the entire Subscription. Additionally,the credentials are valid for 1 year by default*
2. If you see the following error:
   AKV10032: Invalid issuer. Expected one of https://sts.windows.net/0f300d03-624b-418d-bd13-f0dd744dbb4d/, https://sts.windows.net/f8cdef31-a31e-4b4a-93e4-5f571e91255a/, https://sts.windows.net/e2d54eb5-3869-4f70-8578-dee5fc7331f4/, found https://sts.windows.net/fbf7b187-7806-45ad-8d53-e31308109ee5/.

   Run the following command before creating the service principle
```PS
az account set --subscription {SubscriptionID}
```

You should see the following output.

```console
Changing "iac-sp" to a valid URI of "http://iac-sp", which is the required format used for service principal names
Creating a role assignment under the scope of "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
  Retrying role assignment creation: 1/36
  Retrying role assignment creation: 2/36
  Retrying role assignment creation: 3/36
```

## Retrieve and Store the Service Principal Password

The Password that was automatically generated by Azure for the Service Principal is retrievable from the **$Azure_SP** variable.

You can view it out using the following command.

```powershell
($Azure_SP | ConvertFrom-Json).password
```

You can use the following syntax below to store the Password in a variable and then add it to an existing Azure Key Vault.

```powershell
$IaC_SP_Password = ($Azure_SP | ConvertFrom-Json).password

az keyvault secret set `
--name "iac-sp-password" `
--vault-name "myiacvault" `
--value "$IaC_SP_Password" `
--output none
```
